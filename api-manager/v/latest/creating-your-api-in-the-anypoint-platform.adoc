= Creating an API
:keywords: api, raml, sla, gateway

Creating an API in Anypoint Platform involves naming and allocating an API Manager space for the software. You can create an API in Anypoint Platform in the following ways:

* Using API Manager
* link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[Using auto-discovery]
+
link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[Auto-discovery] registers a Mule app created in Studio and configured for discovery. Registration occurs without user intervention.

Regardless of the way you create the API, you need an link:/access-management/creating-an-account[Anypoint Platform account]. If you set up your own account in Anypoint Platform, you are assigned the Organization Administrator role. In this link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/roles[role], you see API Manager when you log into Anypoint Platform.

After creating an API, the API is registered in API Manager and you can perform many management tasks, including these:

* Applying policies
* Enhancing the RAML using API Designer
* Creating a portal for the API to engage users
* Deleting an API from Anypoint Platform

== Naming the API

To create a new API using API Manager, click *Add New API* from the API Administration page.

In the *Add API* dialog, enter a *Name*, *Version*, and brief *Description* of the API, then click *Add API*.

The name cannot exceed 42 characters in length. In the master organization, the conjunction of the API name and version must be unique. If you use business groups, the name must be unique within all your business groups and the master organization. 

To deploy the API on CloudHub, observe link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub#creating-an-application-name[CloudHub naming conventions].

Anypoint Platform uses the name and version to create an administrative command center for your API, called the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] in this document.

== Creating a New Version for an Existing API


API Manager allows you to have multiple versions of the same API existing in parrallel. You can easily create a new version, to do so just click the *Create New Version* button next to the API:

You can create this version from scratch, or you can also base it on prior versions by exporting another version and then importing it here.

This new version of the API will exist together with the already exising versions, and have its own RAML file, its own API Portal and its own address. If you wish, you can also add a *Deprecated* label to an API, to signal this state to your users on the API Portal.

[NOTE]
If you don't see the "Create New Version" button, it may be because your user lacks permissions for carrying out this task on this particular API.


== Importing and Exporting an API

If you want to migrate or copy an existing API Version, you can link:/api-manager/managing-api-versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version.

To import an API:

. From the Anypoint Platform home page, click *API Manager*.
. Click the drop-down arrow in *Add new API*, and select *Import*.
. Browse for and select the .zip file that was exported from Anypoint Platform.

== Deleting an API

On the API Administration page, hover and click in the version area. Click the trash icon that appears in the API information area on the right.
