After you deploy an application, either to CloudHub or your own servers, you can use the Runtime Manager to monitor its performance and that of the server/s it runs on (in case you're deploying on-premises).

Depending on if your application is deployed to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[your own servers], there is currently a different set of possible monitoring resources available. This feature gap will be gradually reduced as new releases implement the missing features on either side.


[TIP]
See the link:/runtime-manager/troubleshooting[Troubleshooting].

== All Applications

On both deployment scenarios, you're able to access information through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts on Runtime Manager] – sends e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.

* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards[Monitoring Dashboards] – See the evolution of key performance metrics related to service usage and available processing power

== CloudHub Applications

With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub], you can also access information through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[Notifications on Runtime Manager] – certain events can trigger notifications that are visible when clicking on the bell icon on the Anypoint Platform

== Monitoring Servers

On applications that are deployed on-premises, you'll be able to obtain information about the servers through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts on Runtime Manager] – sends e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.

* link:/runtime-manager/monitoring-dashboards#the-dashboard-for-a-server[Monitoring Dashboards] – See the evolution of key performance metrics related to service usage and available processing power
