[NOTE]
Dashboards is a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. Users deploying applications to local servers will need to contact their local customer representative for access. See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

The Dashboard gives you in-depth visibility into usage metrics about both your deployed applications and the systems they're deployed to.

The Dashboard helps you answer questions about your integrated apps, such as:

* When did peaks in usage occur?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on response time?
* How well is the processing power behind my app coping with these peaks?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on message fail rate?
* What impact do high traffic peaks of other applications running on the same server have on the performance of a given application?



Using the *Dashboard*, you can view the evolution of metrics about your apps. Going further, you can drill down to the link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insight] section of each app to investigate the fate of individual transactions to help you analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures.


== The Dashboard for Apps on CloudHub

=== Access the Dashboard

To access a CloudHub app's dashboard:

. Select an application in the *Applications* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *Manage Application* button
+
image::dashboards-a2810.png[]
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left

=== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard shows graphs for three separate metrics:

* Mule Messages
* CPU usage, as a percentage of the capacity
* Memory usage



All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

If your application runs on multiple workers at a time, they will be charted as different curves on the same graphs, differentiated by different colors.

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-cloudhub-applications[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.



== The Dashboard for Apps on Servers

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of an on-premises app:

. Select an application in the *Applications* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *Manage Application* button
+
image::dashboards-a2810.png[]
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left

You can also drill down to this dashboard if you first open <<The Dashboard for a Server>> that runs the application, and from there then click on the hyperlink on the name of the application.

=== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard shows graphs for three separate metrics:

* Mule messages
* Error rate
* Response time

All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

If your application runs on a cluster or server group, the aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line.


[TIP]
If you run your app on a Cluster or Server group and want to see these same metrics broken down at individual server level, you can look at <<The Dashboard for a Server, the dashboard for the individual server>>. Note that if multiple apps are running on the server, what you'll see is the overall server performance, without a distinction between each of the apps running on it.

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-locally-deployed-applications[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.

== The Dashboard for a Server

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a server on-premises:

. Select a server in the *Servers* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *View Details* button
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left

////
[TIP]
====
If the server has an issue, click the icon on the *Health* column to access the dashboard directly.

You can also drill down to this dashboard if you first open <<The Dashboard for a Cluster or Server Group>> that contains the server, and from there then click on the hyperlink on the name of the server.

=== Navigating the Dashboard



The dashboard shows three separate metrics:

* CPU usage, as a percentage of the capacity
* Memory usage, in MB
* Heap total, in MB


All graphs can be viewed at different time scales by selecting the desired time interval on the top-right corner.

By hovering your mouse over a given point of a graph, an overlay will display numerical detail about activity on that instant.

If your server runs multiple applications, you can single out one or several and view the performance of these in a separate set of charts. To do so, select one or many, and a side-pannel will display on the right with this data.

[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.

== The Dashboard for a Cluster or Server Group

=== Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a cluster or a server group on-premises:

. Select a cluster or server group in the *Servers* page to open the side pannel
. Click the *View Details* button
. Select the *Dashboard* section on the left



////
[TIP]
====
If the cluster or server group has an issue, click the icon on the *Health* column to access the dashboard directly.

The aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line on the main set of graphs.

You can break down this information into either individual servers or individual applications, note the two tabs that allow you to pick a perspective:

Then, select one or many servers or applications, and a side-pannel will display on the right with this data.

From this menu, you can also click on an individual server name to be taken to the dashboard page for that individual server.


[TIP]
Set up link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.
