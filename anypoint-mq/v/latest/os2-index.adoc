:keywords: Object Store 2, object store, os2, OSv2

Anypoint Object Store version 2 (OSv2) is a cache that lets applications store information temporarily to share data. OSv2 provides a key/list value pair for storing information. The list part of the key/list can be multiple values of a String, number counter, and binary.

This model provides extremely fast data storage and retrieval, and provides true link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence[idempotency] where applications can access data repeatedly with the same result.

OSv2 builds on the existing Mule Object Store (OSv1) and extends it as a true platform object store that can be used for caching and sharing data across applications.

You can use the OSv1 link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/object-store-connector[Object Store connector] with OSv2. The data you store or retrieve using the connector transparently accesses OSv2.

OSv2 provides a REST API model where multiple storage providers can be utilized for optimal speed and efficiency. In effect, OSv2 follows the MuleSoft model of API access so that multiple database sources can be easily added via a Java API to provide the object store manager with extensible storage capabilities:

You can create as many object stores as needed to store different kinds of data. For example, an application can use OSv2 to create an API cache, an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/idempotent-filter[idempotent filter], or a way to store information to share between Mule workers, such as OAuth tokens. All of these are different object stores that can be shared across applications.

== Features

Object Store v2 provides these features:

* Content storage between applications
* REST API for creating and managing object stores
* Anypoint Studio connector
* API caching
* Distributed memory cacheing
* Mule reliability components: IdempotentRouter, UntilSuccessful, and Resequencer
* Node.js microservices

== Workflow

To use Object Store v2:

. Create an application that uses the Object Store connector. From Anypoint Studio,
you can create a simple application using the HTTP connector, Set Payload, Object Store,
and Logger.
. Export the application to Runtime Manager.
. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *Runtime Manager* and click the application so that you can manage settings.
. Click *Application Data* and enable access to Object Store v2.
. Run your application so that data is conveyed to and from the object store.
. Use the Application Data interface to monitor Object Store access to your application.
