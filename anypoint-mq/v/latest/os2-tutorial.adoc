== Creating an Object Store Application

NOTE: Before creating an object store application that you deploy to Runtime Manager, log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform]
and stop any application that may be running so that you can deploy a new application successfully. 

Create an application:

. Open link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio] and create a new project using *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Search for `http` and drag and drop the *HTTP Connector* - Click the green plus to configure and take the default settings (host 0.0.0.0, port 8081, etc.).
. Locate and add *Set Payload* - Provide a message value such as "OK".
. Search for `objectstore` and add the *Object Store Connector*.
. Set the *Operation* to *Store* and set these Store operation values:
** *Key* to `#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.key]`
** *Value Reference* to `#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.value]`
. Click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Ensure your application deploys correctly.
. Right-click your application's name in Package Explorer and click
*Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to Cloud*.
. At the *User login* window, specify your link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] username and password,
and click *Sign in*. If you don't have an Anypoint Platform login, click *Sign up*.
